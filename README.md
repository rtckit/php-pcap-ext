# PHP Packet Capture

Stream driven PHP packet capture extension.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rtckit/php-pcap-ext.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rtckit/php-pcap-ext) ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v0.6.0-green) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Usage

The `pcap` extension has been developed against PHP 7.4+ and regularly tested against the upcoming PHP 8.

The extension provides bindings for [libpcap](https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap) and exposes its functionality via PHP streams; the packet formatting is consistent with the `pcap` file format (learn more [here](https://wiki.wireshark.org/Development/LibpcapFileFormat) and [here](https://formats.kaitai.io/pcap/index.html)). The functionality is deliberately limited to I/O operations, the actual packet parsing/crafting should be performed using pure PHP; such supporting libraries will be open sourced soon.

It's also worth familiarizing yourself with [libpcap and tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/index.html).

A typical capture session can be initiated as follows:

```php
$fp = fopen('pcap://eth0', 'r');
```

The above will initiate the capture session on the `eth0` interface; one can retrieve all network interfaces via `net_get_interfaces()`. An `any` meta-interface is also available.

There are several configuration options exposed through stream contexts:

```php
$context = stream_context_create([
  'pcap' => [
    'snaplen'   => 2048,  // Snapshot length (truncates packets)
    'promisc'   => true,  // Enables promiscuous mode
    'immediate' => true,  // Sets immediate mode (skips buffering)
    'blocking'  => false, // Enables/disables blocking mode (useful in stream_select loops)
    'timeout'   => 0.100, // I/O timeout, in seconds
    'filter'    => 'dst port 53', // Reference: https://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/pcap-filter.7.html
  ],
]);

$fp = fopen('pcap://any', 'r', false, $context);
```

All I/O operations are no different than any other PHP stream, for example:

```php
$fp = fopen('pcap://eth0', 'r');

$header = unpack('LtsSec/LtsUsec/LcapLen/Llen', fread($fp, 16)); // pcap packet header, using local machine endianness
$frame = fread($fp, $header['capLen']);

var_dump($header)
/*
array(4) {
  ["tsSec"]=>
  int(1598997114)
  ["tsUsec"]=>
  int(239648)
  ["capLen"]=>
  int(96)
  ["len"]=>
  int(96)
}
*/

// process($frame) ...
```

The [tests](https://github.com/rtckit/php-pcap-ext/tree/master/tests) directory show cases some usage examples.

## Build

In order to build the extension from source, make sure the environment supports the typical C/C++ build essentials for your platform (`build-essential`), the PHP development files (`php-dev`) as well as the libpcap library and its respective development files (`libpcap-dev`).

```sh
phpize
./configure
make
```

## Tests

Before running the test suite, make sure the user has the ability to capture network packets (root or CAP_RAW).

```sh
make test
```
